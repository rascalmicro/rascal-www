## Privacy Policy ##

At Rascal Micro, we have three fundamental principles about privacy:

 * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we need it.
 * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
 * We don’t store your personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these principles.

Rascal Micro LLC (“Rascal Micro”, "we", "us") operates rascalmicro.com as well as the store hosted by Shopify, reachable at store.rascalmicro.com. It is Rascal Micro’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors ##

Like most sites, Rascal Micro collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as your browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Rascal Micro’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to understand how you use our website. From time to time, Rascal Micro may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a blog post on trends in the rapidly increasing usage of its website.

Rascal Micro also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Rascal Micro only discloses IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that forum poster IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the forum.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information ##

Some visitors to Rascal Micro’s websites choose to interact with Rascal Micro in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Rascal Micro gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask people who want to post in the forums to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Rascal Micro – by buying hardware, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Rascal Micro collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Rascal Micro. Rascal Micro does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. You can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain activities. For example, we can't ship you something if you won't tell us your shipping address.

## Aggregated Statistics ##

Rascal Micro collects statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Rascal Micro uses Google Analytics to figure out what links or web searches brought you to us. Rascal Micro may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Rascal Micro does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information ##

Rascal Micro discloses potentially personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Rascal Micro’s behalf or to provide services available at Rascal Micro’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. Shopify, for example, is in Canada. By using Rascal Micro’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

Rascal Micro will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Rascal Micro discloses potentially personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Rascal Micro believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Rascal Micro, third parties or the public at large.

If you have supplied your email address to Rascal Micro, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date with what’s going on with Rascal Micro and our finely engineered products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. If you want us to stop emailing you, just ask, and we'll stop.

Rascal Micro takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying information.

## Cookies ##

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Rascal Micro uses cookies to help Rascal Micro identify and track visitors, their usage of the Rascal Micro website, and their website access preferences. Rascal Micro visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Rascal Micro’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Rascal Micro’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. In particular, refusing cookies will prevent forum posting and the use of the store.

## Business Transfers ##

If Rascal Micro or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the highly undesirable event that Rascal Micro goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Rascal Micro may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Forum Posts ##

All posts in the Rascal Micro forums are publicly available and may be indexed by search engines. If you want to keep something secret, do not mention that information in the forums.

## Privacy Policy Changes ##

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Rascal Micro may change its privacy policy from time to time, and at Rascal Micro’s sole discretion. Rascal Micro encourages visitors to check this page for any changes to its privacy policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
