    <p>The Rascal won the <a href="http://postscapes.com/best-iot-open-source-project-2011">Editors' Choice award</a> in the Open Source Project category at <a href="http://postscapes.com">Postscapes</a> a few days ago. Postscapes is a site in South Korea that tracks the "internet of things," which means stuff like the Rascal, more or less. In the aftermath of the contest, Trevor Harwood of Postscapes and I recorded a discussion of the various topics related to connecting stuff to the internet, open source hardware, and the Rascal. Trevor was kind enough to transcribe and discretize the discussion so you can absorb it in palatable chunks.</p>
