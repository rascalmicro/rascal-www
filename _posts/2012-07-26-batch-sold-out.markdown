title: One batch sold out, the next in the works
categories: rascal

I put the most recent batch of 20 Rascals up for sale earlier this week. These Rascals were hardware version 1.2 and had the final Anthrax release of the Rascal software. The batch sold out approximately 9 minutes after the announcement went out to the mailing list. There were a few alert folks who noticed the Rascal in stock before the official announcement, but I did get a flood of emails expressing a mix of frustration and disappointment that the Rascals were gone so quickly. Sorry for the frustrating experience-- the next batch is 5 times larger and should be up for sale in a few weeks, for some flexible value of "weeks."

The Rascal has now been shipped to Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, South Korea, Thailand and the US. Thanks so much to all of you that have shown interest in the Rascal.

### Plan for the release of Beriberi ###

I plan to load the next batch of Rascals with a new software release, codenamed "Beriberi" as the alphabetic successor to Anthrax. If you're using Anthrax on your Rascal, we'd love to hear reports of bugs or feature suggestions in the [forums][1]. Even in the current release, the majority of the non-stock code (specifically, a lot of the editor, the Python hardware library, and the interrupt handler) was contributed by Rascal users.

If it's useful, all of the non-stock-Linux/Python code shipped on the Rascal can be found in [Rascal Micro's code repositories][2] on Github.
