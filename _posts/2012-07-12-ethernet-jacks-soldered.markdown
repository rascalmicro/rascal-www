### Finally got Ethernet jacks ###

After many weeks of waiting, the Ethernet jacks I needed to finish this batch of Rascals finally arrived. The rest of the components had been soldered by a robot in Colorado; I soldered the last piece in by hand for each board.

Over the next few days, I'll be testing the hardware to make sure the batch works the same as our first two demo units. In theory, the hardware is 100% identical, but I want to be certain.

When the next batch is up for sale, I'll post it here, on the [Rascal Twitter account][1], and send a message to the mailing list. Thanks for all the inquiries you all have sent me over the last few weeks since [the Engadget article][2] was posted; it's pleasant to be reminded that people want this thing.
